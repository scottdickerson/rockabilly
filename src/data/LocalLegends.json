    "description": "In 1933, Billy Lee Riley was born the son of a sharecropper in Pocahontas, where he learned to play the guitar from black farmworkers. He signed with Sun Records in 1956 and released <i>Trouble Bound</i>, with <i>Rock with Me Baby</i> on the B side. Riley followed up with <i>Red Hot</i> in 1957, and while the record had the potential to be a hit, it never found commercial success because Sun chose to focus on promoting Jerry Lee Lewis instead. Riley went on to release several more records, but they also failed to find a widespread audience. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he played with the likes of Dean Martin and The Beach Boys. In a twist of fate, Riley experienced newfound popularity in the late 1970s with the Rockabilly Revival in Europe and released new records in the 1990s and 2000s. Riley passed away on August 2, 2009 in Jonesboro.",

    "description": "Born Ethmer Cletus Rhodes in Pocahontas (or Poughkeepsie) in 1913, “Slim” Rhodes was an American country and rockabilly musician who found his greatest popularity in the 1940s and 1950s. Performing as Slim Rhodes and His Mountaineers, Rhodes signed with Sun Records in 1955 and recorded a mix of country and rockabilly songs. His best known rockabilly releases were <i>Do What I Do</i> and <i>Gonna Romp and Stomp</i>. The band also toured with other Sun artists throughout the South between 1955 and 1957.  Just as Rhodes&rsquo;s career was waning, he died in an accident in Memphis in 1966.",

    "description": "Albert Austin “Sonny” Burgess was born on a small farm in Newport, Arkansas on May 28, 1929. He was a rockabilly prodigy whose on-stage antics won him the nickname “the wild man of rock and roll.” He started out playing boogie woogie music in the early 1950s around Newport with his band, the Rocky Road Ramblers. The band renamed itself The Moonlighters in 1954, and then, on the advice of producer Sam Phillips expanded and renamed itself The Pacers. They released their first songs, <i>We Wanna Boogie</i> and <i>Red-Headed Woman</i> on Sun Records in 1956. These energetic rockabilly songs came to characterize the band’s style. The Pacers disbanded in 1971, but came back together for the rockabilly revival in Europe in the 1980s. While Burgess passed away in 2017, the band continued to perform together at festivals and special events.",

After returning home in 1954, Deckelman found popularity with Memphis audiences but couldn’t secure a record deal. After a brief stint in California, Deckelman returned home, formed The Bop Kings, and founded his own record label, Van-Deck. Through Van-Deck, he released the rockabilly songs <i>I’ve Got Love</i> and <i>Born to Lose</i> in 1959. While the songs were local hits, Deckelman never found national fame. As rockabilly’s appeal waned in the 1960s, he continued to release songs but faded into obscurity.",
